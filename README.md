# Green Computing

This is the official repository of the "Green Computing" study group at the summer academy of the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes in Leysin. Any announcements, plans, available topics, and hardware will be placed here. We plan to make the whole experience as open and inviting as possible.

Please use the [official website](https://(greeniot.github.io) as starting point.
