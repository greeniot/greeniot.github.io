title: "All about Memory"
description: "A closer look on properties and usages of different types of memory."
questions:
  - What kinds of memory are there in a typical computer system?
  - How do they work on a hardware level and what are their properties with respect to volatility, feature size, speed, energy consumption, cost, etc.?
  - Given these properties, which type of memory is used in which parts of a computer system?
  - How does this all lead to the overall memory hierarchy?
  - How does the memory hierarchy differ for various computer systems (from supercomputers to embedded devices)?
  - What are some cutting edge methods to enhance memory size, speed and energy efficiency?
