title: "GPIO using the I2C and SPI Bus on the Raspberry Pi"
description: "Just like computers, embedded devices profit from standardized interfaces for communication and interaction. We will focus on I2C and SPI as two pivotal representatives."
questions:
  - What makes a pin a GPIO pin?
  - How does the I2C protocol look like? Can the specific implementation be abstracted away to understand the key features of any communication protocol?
  - What is a timing diagram and how can we use one to illustrate the details of the I2C protocol?
  - Briefly, how does the SPI bus differ? How do I2C and SPI compare with respect to speed, prevalence in industry and other aspects?
  - How does one get an Arduino or a Texas Instruments device to talk to a sensor via I2C?
