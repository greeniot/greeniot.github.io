title: "Power-efficient Memory and Caches"
description: "Energy efficient usage of memory and caches."
questions:
  - Can you remind us quickly about memory organization and caches?
  - How can we quickly understand key drivers of energy consumption when it comes to different kinds of memory and caches?
  - What are the basic possibiliyies and ideas to reduce power consumption of accessing memory both on the lower level (transistors) and the higher level (memory access)?
  - How can one approach the lower level optimizations?
  - How are higher level ideas implemented? (Probably not all of them, choose some important ones.)
