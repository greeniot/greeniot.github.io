title: "Better Than Worst-Case Computing"
description: "Usually worst-case component specifications are used in component design. Given that most systems operate under typical operating conditions therefore implies a significant performance cost."
questions:
  - What does worst-case specification mean?
  - On which levels do we find conservative worst-case design choices?
  - In which areas exists a significant discrepancy between the worst-case specification and the typical runtime conditions?
  - How can these descrepancies be exploited for performance improvements?
  - What are the biggest challenges of Better Than Worst Case design?
  - Why does frequency tuning work, e.g., for PC gamers?
  - How much power is potentially lost by worst-case designs?
  - What mechanism(s) can be used to lower the voltage automatically?
  - When is the inductance-caused power supply voltage-droop problem relevant?
  - What can be done in circuit design to improve efficiency, i.e., perform TCO?
