title: "Basics of Computer Systems"
description: "The fundamental building blocks of almost every computer system, a high level description of how they work, what they do and how they play together."
questions:
  - How can we identify and understand the basic building blocks of a computer system and their responsibilities without going into too much detail?
  - What are those parts made of in general and, roughly, how do they fulfil their tasks?
  - How do these building blocks communicate and work together? Who is in charge, what is the control flow and which channels are used to delegate tasks.
  - Roughly, how fast and energy efficient are the various parts or processes in comparison to each other?
