title: "Where does the Power go - the Physics"
description: "To discuss energy efficiency we have to go down to the smallest building blocks - transistors. We explain the physics of CMOS components and thereby discover where most power is consumed."
questions:
  - What is a transistor, how is it made what are its properties?
  - What are CMOS components, why do we care and what are their characteristics?
  - How do single transistors form logical units and what does the physical layout of a typical CMOS component, e.g., a NAND gate, look like?
  - In which ways is power dissipated in CMOS components?
  - Roughly, what are the key drivers of power dissipation and can we model that mathematically?
  - What is subthreshold and gate leakage?
  - What architectural techniques exist to reduce leakages?
