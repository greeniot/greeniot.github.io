title: "Details of the ARM Architecture"
description: "We explore the ARM architecture and why it is such a huge success."
questions:
  - What are the characteristics and differences of RISC and CISC architectures?
  - What are the key features of the ARM architecture?
  - How exactly can ARM chips reduce power consumption and heat dissipation compared to other architectures?
  - How successful are ARM chips in different fields / devices?
  - Can you go into some detail about the register set, the instruction set and the evolution of the pipeline in ARM architectures?
  - What would it take for a new or completely different architecture to be as successful and do you think this is possible in the near future?
