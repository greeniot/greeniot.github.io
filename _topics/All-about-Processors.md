description: "A closer look on what is inside a processing unit and how it works."
questions:
  - What are the different parts of a typical CPU and what is each of them responsible for?
  - Are there any fundamental limitations on execution speed, throughput and power consumption?
  - How is a program executed, i.e., what is the fetch-(decode)-execute-(write) loop, branching?
  - What are common issues with arising in the execution context?
  - How does pipelining work, why should we care and what are its limits?
  - Can we shed light onto the buzzwords simultaneous multithreading, hyperthreading, multitasking, superscalar architectures, SIMD and parallel computing and put them in context?
