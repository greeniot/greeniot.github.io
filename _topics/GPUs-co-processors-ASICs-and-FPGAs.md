title: "GPUs, co-processors, ASICs and FPGAs"
description: "We explore why GPUs are a common tool in high-performance computing, how heterogeneous system architecture works and what other specialized hardware exists."
questions:
  - What are the characteristics of a GPU compared to a regular processor?
  - Which properties makes GPUs attractive for high performance computing (HPC)?
  - What are the advantages and disadvantages of heterogeneous system design?
  - What are co-processors used for in HPC?
  - Can you describe an important example of a widely used co-processor in more detail?
  - What are ASICs and FPGAs and where do you see their potential in HPC?
