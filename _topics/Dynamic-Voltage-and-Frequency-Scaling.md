title: "Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling"
description: "A closer look on one of the most important power management aspects, dynamic adjustment of the supplied voltage and the effective clock frequency to current demands."
questions:
  - What role do supply voltage and clock frequency play in terms of power consumption?
  - How can dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) be achieved?
  - What is the benefit that can be obtained in hardware vs. software?
  - What implementation exists on the market?
  - Is there any general advice you can give a computer system designer on supply voltage and frequency?
