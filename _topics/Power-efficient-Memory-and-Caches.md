title: "Power-Efficient Memory and Caches"
description: "As one of the most important parts of any computer systems, memory also adds substantialy to the overall power consumption. We will explore some advanced techniques to minimize energy waste."
questions:
  - Can you remind us quickly about memory organization and caches?
  - How can we quickly understand key drivers of energy consumption when it comes to different kinds of memory and caches?
  - What are the basic ideas to reduce power consumption of accessing memory both on the lower level (transistors) and the higher level (memory organization)?
  - How can one approach the lower level optimizations?
  - How are higher level ideas implemented? (Probably not all of them, choose some important ones.)
