title: "Low-level Software Optimization"
description: "In high performance or energy limited applications every clock cycle counts. We explore how code can be optimized on lower levels."
questions:
  - Why would most code (e.g. normal if-then-else structures and loops) be slow when executed exactly like it is written?
  - Which issues can slow down execution / require unnecessary cycles that could in principle be circumvented?
  - Can you give an overview of the various possible techniques and what they aim at?
  - Which optimizations can be performed during compile time?
  - Can we still achieve optimizations during run time?
