title: "Scaling Towards Exaflops with Heterogeneous Architectures"
description: "Homogeneous architectures seem to be outdated - these days specialized components are mixed to increase efficiency for predefined applications."
questions:
  - What are the problems of homogeneous systems?
  - What is the anticipated MTBF for an exaflop system?
  - How can heterogeneous architectures help to increase performance?
  - Which challenges are faced in the design of hetergeneous architectures?
  - Can you name 2-3 examples of real system exhibiting an heterogeneous architecture?
  - What problems occur in the implementation of software for such systems?
  - Which components are mixed (and why), which won't be mixed (and why)?
