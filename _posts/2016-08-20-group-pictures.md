title: Group Pictures
---
For the second week we still have some things planned. Besides the upcoming excursion to the CERN we may offer a group hiking day on Tuesday or Thursday. Furthermore, we will definitely try to take a group picture and individual pictures, which can be assigned to the talks. This will be very helpful in the longrun - memories!

Last, but not least we will also try to include another maker afternoon. The last one was quite successful even though we did not manage to accomodate the appropriate help for everyone. Next time the setup steps will be much easier and we are optimistic to provide you all with more help.

Finally, some of you already started with the upload of their final presentations. This is great. You can either use a PR (Pull Request) on GitHub or upload the file with the link (upload to DropBox) we've send around earlier. More details on this will follow in an email after the academy.
