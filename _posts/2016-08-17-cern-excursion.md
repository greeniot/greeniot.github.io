On Wednesday, the 24th of August, we'll go with the bus to the CERN research facilities. The bus will start at 7am. The breakfast will be served starting at 6:30am.

The following things should be considered:

* You need to bring an identity document
* Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://visits.web.cern.ch/sites/visits.web.cern.ch/files/files/tours/Code%20of%20conduct%20for%20visitors%20to%20CERN%20EN.pdf)
* There are also some [Frequently Asked Questions](http://visits.web.cern.ch/tours/frequently-asked-questions) online
* For safety reasons, open-toed, and high-heeled shoes are not permitted

We will arrive at the CERN reception (found in building 33) 15 minutes before the start of the tour. The tour will go for 3 hours.
