title: Participant Survey Distributed
---
We just sent out an e-mail that contains the link to an initial survey we'd like everyone to take. The participant survey gives us important information on how to schedule the talks and what topics to offer. After evaluating the responses we will create a list of topics. This requires adjusting the schedule accordingly. In the end we hope to satisfy everyone's hope and aspirations towards the study group.

We don't want to publish the link for participating in the initial survey. If you did not receive an e-mail then contact us directly via e-mail.
