title: Topic list available
---
We have released a list of topics we want to cover in the study group. Every participant is going to give a talk on one of them. You find the list at http://greeniot.github.io/topics/. We also just sent out an e-mail that contains the link to a form where you can select your three favorite topics.

We don't want to publish the link for the topic selection form. If you did not receive an e-mail, please contact us directly via e-mail.
