title: Compendium Released
---
The compendium that includes all papers with their authors and contact information as well as the tutorials that were created before, during and partly after Leysin is now finally finished. You should have received an e-mail with the corresponding Dropbox link. If you did not receive such an e-mail, please contact us.

We want to thank you all again for your efforts. The compendium came out just as awesome as we hoped it would be before the academy. This is your collective achievement and you can be proud of it! Stay tuned for the "after Leysin" meeting. More information will follow in early 2017. Have a nice pre-Christmas season!
