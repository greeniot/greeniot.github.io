title: Results of the Participant Survey
---
Thanks to everyone who responded to the survey. Overall, we received 20 responses from the 21 participants (95%). This gives us some indicator what the expectations are and what we can do to make this an enjoyable and informative experience for everyone.

No surprise was the received semester and the field of study distribution. For the semester we see that most participants are at the starting point of their academic career.

![Semester Distribution](/images/survey/semester.png)

As the topic of the study group is a technical one the technical fields of study are represented quite well.

![Field Of Study](/images/survey/field-of-study.png)

Most people expect a rather good balance between purely practical (1) and hardcore theoretical (5) topics.

![Course Expectations](/images/survey/course-expectations.png)

This is then also confirmed by their existing knowledge. For instance, most participants have a clear impression about the physical units that are important to quantify energy efficiency.

Consequently, it is simple for the participants to estimate the power of some common devices.

The practical background with electronics is definitely here, but no one considers himself / herself to be a master.

![Proficiency Breadboard](/images/survey/proficiency-breadboard.png)

The background is confirmed by the participants' previous experience with electronics. Nearly everyone has already worked with a breadboard.

![Electronics Experience](/images/survey/experience-electronics.png)

The most common symbols for analog electronics are known, but more special symbols that are used in digital electronics seem to be beyond the horizon.

![Graphical Symbols](/images/survey/graphical-symbols.png)

Could you make a circuit that is capable of adding two numbers? Which transistors would you use? A difficult question that requires some knowledge in electronic engineering. I guess we will use part of the study group to enhance this knowledge.

Going to more programming related questions we, however, see why such a study group makes sense. For instance, more than half of the participants have never programmed for a microcontroller.

Therefore, for most of the participants there was no need to edit files remotely, e.g., via Vim, Emacs, or Nano.

The command line, however, is a good friend to the average participant of this study group.

![Command Line](/images/survey/command-line.png)

We will use this study group to explain why version control systems (VCS) such as git should be part of the daily utility belt. Today, most participants have no experience with a VCS.

![Version Control](/images/survey/version-control.png)

Regarding modern computer architecture the most important concepts are known. The memory hierarchy for instance is trivial for the audience.

![Memory Hierarchy](/images/survey/computer-memory.png)

The clock rate (or simply: clock), which refers to the frequency at which a chip (e.g., the CPU) is processing instructions is also clear to most participants.

![Frequency Clock](/images/survey/frequency-clock.png)

A little bit more problematic is knowledge about current trends in CPU design, e.g., simultaneous multi-threading.

![Multi-Threading](/images/survey/multi-threading.png)

We also wanted to know what programming languages are known and used. We limited the responses to three. The following programming languages appear to be popular among the participants.

![Programming Languages Popularity](/images/survey/popularity-programming-languages.png)

The knowledge distribution is rather unique. While exotic languages (not a very high popularity) seem to be mastered without trouble, standard languages (again measured with the popularity above) seem to be difficult to master. The reasoning seems obvious: One only picks an exotic language if there is a specific need (already learned other languages, or the specific language covers a particular scenario), such that mastering the language is definitely on the list.

Finally, we've been interested in the tendency towards different areas within this study group.

![Weights](/images/survey/weights.png)

To our surprise IoT is the least interesting one, with supercomputing being in high-demand. Information on power efficiency in general components is right in the middle. Luckily, the group seems to be right in the middle such that all three areas should be covered.
